### Notable Project: FE2TAS  

One of my most significant projects is **FE2TAS**, a tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) tool for the ROBLOX game *Flood Escape 2*. This script, executed via a script injector, provides an environment for creating TAS runs. FE2TAS includes a sandbox for live recording of inputs and playback in real-time.  

> **Note:** *This project is compatible only with [Flood Escape 2 2022](https://www.roblox.com/games/95410451364746/FE2-2022).*  

#### Key Features:  
- **Frame Advance**: Step forward one frame at a time for precise control.  
- **In-Depth Part Colors**: Highlights parts, meshes, and unions, including unanchored objects and sloped parts, for better visualization.  
- **Climbing Tool Raycast**: Visualizes raycasts from your `HumanoidRootPart` to determine climbable parts.  
- **Hallway Tool Raycast**: Generates a raycast in your movement direction to enable smooth corner cutting.  
- **Button Hitboxes**: Displays button interaction zones, including an extended option to reveal buttons through walls.  
- **Compact Binary Saving**: Saves data using a specific binary format, reducing file size by eliminating redundancy.  

While FE2TAS is continuously updated, it differs from my newest project, **FE2CMTAS**, which I am actively developing.

### FE2CMTAS  

**FE2CMTAS** is a new project inspired by [8y8x](https://github.com/8y8x), aimed at providing an exploit-free way to create TAS runs in *Flood Escape 2*!  

This tool works by loading a map in [Flood Escape 2 Community Maps](), completely replacing the game environment with its own. With **FE2CMTAS**, users can TAS any map in Community Maps, offering greater flexibility and an exciting new way to approach TAS creation.
