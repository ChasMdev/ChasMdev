### Notable Project: FE2TAS  

One of my coolest projects is **FE2TAS**, a tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) tool for the ROBLOX game *Flood Escape 2*. This is a script you can execute with a script injector, giving you an environment to create TAS runs. It comes with a sandbox where you can live record your inputs and play them back in real time.  

> **Note:** *This only works in [Flood Escape 2 2022](https://www.roblox.com/games/95410451364746/FE2-2022).*  

#### Key Features:  
- **Frame Advance**: Lets you step forward one frame at a time for super precise control.  
- **In-Depth Part Colors**: Highlights parts, meshes, and unions, and also shows unanchored objects and sloped parts for easier visualization.  
- **Climbing Tool Raycast**: Shoots a raycast from your `HumanoidRootPart` to determine if you can climb on a part.  
- **Hallway Tool Raycast**: Draws a raycast in your movement direction, making it easier to cut corners smoothly.  
- **Button Hitboxes**: Shows button interaction zones and includes an option to reveal buttons through walls.  
- **Compact Binary Saving**: Saves data in a tiny, optimized binary format where no data is repeated, keeping file sizes small.  

This project is still being updated, but Iâ€™m also working on something even better: **FE2CMTAS**!

### FE2CMTAS  

**FE2CMTAS** is my latest project, inspired by [8y8x](https://github.com/8y8x), and it's designed to bring an exploit-free way of creating TAS runs in *Flood Escape 2*!  

It works by loading a map in [Flood Escape 2 Community Maps](), completely destroying the default game environment, and rebuilding it from scratch. The best part? Youâ€™re not limited to the maps in the main gameâ€”you can TAS any map in Community Maps!
