### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm ChasM, a ROBLOX Game Developer and 3D Modeler.

I have experience with several programming languages, including:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: 2 years

I also have some familiarity with **C**, **Rust**, and **C++**.

### Notable Project: FE2TAS

One of my most significant projects is **FE2TAS**, a tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) exploit for the ROBLOX game *Flood Escape 2*. It is a script executed via a script injector, providing an environment to create TAS runs. FE2TAS includes a sandbox for live recording of inputs and the ability to replay them in real-time. *note: This only works in the game [Flood Escape 2 2022](https://www.roblox.com/games/95410451364746/FE2-2022)*

#### Key Features:
- **Frame Advance**: Step forward one frame at a time for precise control.
- **In-Depth Part Colors**: Highlights parts, meshes, and unions, including unanchored objects and sloped parts, for better visualization.
- **Climbing Tool Raycast**: Produces a raycast from the center of your `HumanoidRootPart` to determine if a part is climbable.
- **Hallway Tool Raycast**: Generates a raycast from your `HumanoidRootPart` in your movement direction, enabling smooth corner cutting.
- **Button Hitboxes**: Displays button interaction zones, including an extended option to reveal buttons through walls.
- **Compact Binary Saving**: Uses a specific binary save format that eliminates repeated data, resulting in minimal file sizes.

This project is constantly being updated, however it is not the same as the new FE2CMTAS Project I am actively working on.

### FE2CMTAS

This is a project, similar to [8y8x](https://github.com/8y8x)'s project that aims to bring an exploit-free way of creating a TAS to Flood Escape 2!
